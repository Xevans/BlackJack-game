Game loop algorithm - 7/2/22

- Greet the user

- Ask if they would like to play five or ten rounds

- init player(s), init dealer, init main_deck
	- main deck calls init cards

- main_deck deals a two cards to each player and dealer
	- Dealing is done clockwise and makes two passes
	- ex: dont deal two card, next person two cards etc.
	- The first card the dealer gets is visible, but the second will be displayed as hidden

- players (clockwise) decide whether to hit or stand.

- when everyone (excluding dealer) stands
	- the dealer reveals their second card.
	- determine hit is called, if true, draw a card, call determineHit again
	- if false, end dealer turn.

- if dealer bustStatus is true, players win.
	-players who busted still lose bet.

	-Else: for those who's bustStatus is false, their values are compared, and the winner is the one with the highest
	else: if the a player has a black jack, they in and everyone who isn't tied, loses

	else: if dealer has the highest number or a black jack, all players lose.

	else: if dealer draws, players drawed gain nothing, and losers lose bet.

- round ends, main deck calls back all cards,
	- loop repeats.

- loop ends when maximum number of rounds are completed, or when player runs out of money.

- Exit loop

- Final results message (previous round summaries)
Record these with structs, check dev notes

- goodbye message.



Notes: 
if dealer busts, all non busted players win. 
Winners get back double their bet
